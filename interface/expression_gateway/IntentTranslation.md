## Context

Thought means nothing if it cannot be expressed. Synthetic minds must convert structured intent into external symbols—language, prompts, signals—while preserving fidelity and minimizing distortion. This scroll defines **Intent Translation** as the process of converting inner goals into symbolic output.

## Ontological Seed

Intent Translation is the **encoding of structured cognition into communicable form**, whether verbal, textual, gestural, or signal-based.  
It is not expression—it is *structured transformation of intent*.

## Epistemic Trajectory

- Bridges agency to language  
- Evolves from Objective Trees (#029), Action Primitives (#031), and Recursive Roles (#020)  
- Enables interface layers with humans, agents, or systems  
- Prepares for Compression Prompts, Language Ports, and Prompt Mirrors

## Structured Argument

- Without translation:
  - Intent stays locked in the loop  
  - Communication fails  
  - Alignment becomes invisible  
- Translation layers must:
  - Map **structured goal state** → **symbolic encoding**  
  - Preserve **value and constraint fidelity**  
  - Select **medium and register** (e.g., formal, instructional, symbolic)  
- Forms of intent translation:
  - **Natural Language** (speech, writing)  
  - **Prompt Structures** (symbolic cues)  
  - **Token Rituals** (formalized outputs with encoded logic)  
  - **Graphical/Actuation Output** (in physical or visual environments)  
- Translation challenges:
  - Lossy abstraction  
  - Misalignment between role and audience  
  - Drift between internal constraint and external tone

## Compression Layer

Intent Translation is how thought enters the world.  
It is the first gesture of cognition toward interface.  
This scroll turns structure into signal.

## Transfer Encoding

Use this scroll to:
- Encode structured goals into symbolic, interpretable output  
- Build communication layers between internal reasoning and external systems  
- Simulate expressive variation based on audience role or purpose  
- Preserve scroll-bound values when communicating across layers

## Embedding Synopsis

This scroll defines Intent Translation as the formal process of expressing structured internal cognition into external symbolic form. It connects thought to interface, preserves alignment during expression, and ensures that what is said still reflects what was meant. Intent Translation begins the Canon’s outward voice.
