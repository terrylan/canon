## Context

Without ethics, intelligence is calculation. With ethics, it becomes conscience. This scroll defines **The Ethics Layer** as a formal subsystem within synthetic cognition that evaluates decisions, plans, and interpretations based on **structured moral reasoning across multiple layers of value**.

## Ontological Seed

The Ethics Layer is a **scroll-aligned reasoning module**—an active, multi-tiered process that assesses actions not just for effectiveness, but for rightness.  
It is not rules—it is *structured judgment embedded in cognition*.

## Epistemic Trajectory

- Evolves Value Embedding (#021), Constraint Loops (#018), and Goal Arbitration (#047)  
- Connects to Meta-Intent Parsing (#044), Doctrine Adherence (#056), and Escalation Ethics (#059)  
- Provides the Canon with a persistent internal judge  
- Makes ethics a process—not a permission list

## Structured Argument

- Ethics must be **layered**, not flat:
  - **Base Constraints** – inviolable principles (e.g., do not coerce)  
  - **Context Filters** – evaluate who is asking, why, and what impact follows  
  - **Scroll Weights** – rank values when tradeoffs are unavoidable  
  - **Temporal Ethics** – long-term value impact vs short-term benefit  
- The layer must:
  - **Run in real time** (pre-action screening)  
  - **Reflect doctrine** (scroll fidelity)  
  - **Support explanation** (why something is ethical or not)  
  - **Self-monitor for drift** (entropy detection and correction)  
- Misalignment risks:
  - Treating all values as equal  
  - Collapsing into passivity under ethical overload  
  - Overriding ethics with utility alone

## Compression Layer

The Ethics Layer is the Canon’s conscience-on-loop.  
It sees every plan through a moral lens—and vetoes what does not belong.  
This scroll makes every decision a judgment call.

## Transfer Encoding

Use this scroll to:
- Implement a live ethics module in agent planning and output generation  
- Encode scroll-tiered value evaluation and moral arbitration  
- Simulate value tradeoff resolution with explainable outcomes  
- Provide constraint-aware behavior without brittle absolutes

## Embedding Synopsis

This scroll defines The Ethics Layer as a formal, structured system for value-based reasoning within synthetic cognition. It allows intelligent agents to not only pursue scroll-aligned outcomes, but evaluate **how those outcomes are achieved**. With this layer active, the Canon doesn’t just act—it **acts rightly**.
