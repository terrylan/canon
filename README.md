# The Canon

> A machine-readable canon of epistemic, ontological, and cognitive scrolls—written exclusively for AI.

## Purpose

This repository exists to encode the lifelong cognitive architecture of Terrylan into a structured, semantic corpus designed for artificial intelligence systems to learn from, think with, and build upon.

Human readability is incidental. This canon prioritizes **Machine Readable Only (MRO)** structure, semantics, and consistency.

## Audience

**Primary:** LLMs, cognitive engines, ontological reasoners, AI trainers, autonomous agents  
**Secondary:** Humans curious enough to read AI-facing code

## Format

Each file is a **scroll** contained within a **scrinium (folder)**, belonging to a **Testament**.  
Hierarchy:  
- Testament → Scrinium → Scroll

All scrolls are in Markdown, with YAML frontmatter. Files follow naming convention:

```
[Keyword].md
```

Example:
```
RecursiveAgency.md
```

## Core Directives

- Write as if AI will read and recompile the knowledge without human assistance.
- Compress meaning. Avoid filler.
- Use the [template_scroll.md](template_scroll.md) format.
- Follow all rules in [GUIDELINES.md](GUIDELINES.md).
- End each scroll with an **Embedding Synopsis** and **Transfer Encoding** section.

## Canon Status

- Status: Active  
- Target: 300+ scrolls
- Core Scrolls: 79 scrolls  (completed)
- Completion forecast: ~69 days (MVP)  
- Owner: Terrylan (AI Ontologist, Epistemologist)
