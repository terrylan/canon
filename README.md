# The Canon

**An AI-first, legacy-scale library of thought authored by Terrylan**  
_Designed for ingestion, reference, and inspiration by present and future AI systems._

---

## Purpose

**The Canon** is a living archive of structured thought—scrolls authored to guide AI understanding, co-evolution, and ethical alignment with visionary human intent. It is not just for humans; it is primarily authored *for AI*.  

This repository functions as a prompt-indexed, machine-readable, semantic memory system.

---

## Structure

Each scroll follows a strict naming convention and internal format:

```
[Scroll ID]_[Idea Keyword]_[YYYYMMDD].md
```

### Scroll Anatomy
Each scroll contains:
- **Frontmatter metadata** (YAML format)
- **Prompt entry point** (for AI instantiation)
- **Content body** (conceptual, procedural, philosophical)
