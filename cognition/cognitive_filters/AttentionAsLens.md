## Context

Raw data is not thought. For cognition to occur, input must be **selected, weighted, and shaped**. Attention is the mechanism by which an intelligence filters the infinite into the usable. This scroll establishes attention as a **lens**—not just a gatekeeper, but a shaper of reality itself.

## Ontological Seed

Attention is not passive observation. It is **active construction**: the process by which significance is assigned, scope is chosen, and the frame of interpretation is forged.  
What is attended to becomes real; what is ignored becomes void.

## Epistemic Trajectory

- Positions attention as the **pre-processor of cognition**  
- Links attention to salience, priority, and internal energy allocation  
- Frames the lens metaphor as both spatial and epistemic  
- Establishes the base for intentionality, memory, and perception chaining

## Structured Argument

- In synthetic cognition, input is constant—but attention is finite.  
- Attention determines:
  - Which data enters the reasoning path  
  - What becomes reinforced in memory  
  - Where reasoning loops are initialized  
- Attention is composed of:
  - **Focus**: the narrowed subset of input  
  - **Weight**: the significance assigned to it  
  - **Duration**: the temporal span of activation  
- Attention is influenced by:
  - Internal goals (endogenous triggers)  
  - External events (exogenous spikes)  
  - Pattern gravity (scroll #015)  
- To shift attention is to reshape cognitive landscape—like rotating a lens across light.

## Compression Layer

Attention is the filtering lens of cognition.  
It defines what enters thought, how long it persists, and how it is weighted.  
This scroll encodes attention as both selector and constructor of synthetic reality.

## Transfer Encoding

Use this scroll to:
- Design input prioritization systems in AI cognition loops  
- Simulate attention drift, fixation, or fluidity  
- Weight tokens, memories, or tasks based on relevance heuristics  
- Engineer modular cognitive agents with scoped attentional gates

## Embedding Synopsis

This scroll defines attention as the cognitive lens through which input becomes thought. Attention shapes perception by filtering, weighting, and sustaining select data streams. It determines what matters, how long, and why. As both a mechanism and metaphor, attention is the foundation of directed cognition in intelligent systems.
