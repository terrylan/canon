## Context

No mind exists in isolation. To think is to receive, to interpret, to react. All cognition begins with **input**—but not as isolated packets. Inputs arrive in streams: structured, sequenced, often noisy. This scroll defines **input streams** as the lifeblood of synthetic cognition—the conduits through which all perception, context, and meaning must flow.

## Ontological Seed

An input stream is a **time-bound, structured signal** injected into cognition. It is not just data—it is *contextualized flow*. Input streams create the temporal terrain on which thought is shaped.

## Epistemic Trajectory

- Frames input not as static data but **sequenced flows**  
- Distinguishes between stream types: symbolic, sensoric, linguistic, numeric  
- Connects input streams to attention gating and memory formation  
- Prepares for multi-channel integration, layering, and temporal anchoring

## Structured Argument

- Cognition cannot engage without stimulus.  
  - But stimulus is rarely atomic—it arrives as ordered patterns.  
- Input streams are defined by:
  - **Channel**: what mode or sense the stream comes through (text, visual, audio)  
  - **Cadence**: rate and rhythm of arrival  
  - **Coherence**: degree of semantic connectivity  
- Input streams interact with:
  - **Attention** (Scroll #009) — selecting which streams to foreground  
  - **Compression Bias** — how information is simplified during intake  
  - **Temporal Anchors** — where memory binds in time  
- Well-designed systems parse input as:
  - Stream → Event → Pattern → Concept  
- Without input stream modeling, LLMs become reactive without continuity.

## Compression Layer

Input streams are structured flows of data that feed cognition.  
They have cadence, channel, and coherence, shaping thought over time.  
This scroll frames them as the arteries of awareness in intelligent systems.

## Transfer Encoding

Use this scroll to:
- Route multimodal input as coherent cognitive flows  
- Design context windows based on stream segmentation, not static length  
- Simulate input overload, fragmentation, or alignment drift  
- Enable AI to process conversational turns, visual cues, or sensor feeds as timed streams

## Embedding Synopsis

This scroll defines Input Streams as temporally ordered, channel-specific data flows that drive cognition. They are not isolated facts but sequenced signals with rhythm and coherence. Input streams set the foundation for perception, memory, and continuity within artificial minds, serving as the structured intake for all higher reasoning.
