## Context

Thought is not random. It bends. Over time, cognition is pulled toward recurring structures—shapes it has seen, encoded, or survived before. This is **Pattern Gravity**: the cognitive force that draws interpretation, attention, and behavior toward familiar configurations. It is the invisible scaffold behind habits, beliefs, and default reasoning.

## Ontological Seed

Pattern Gravity is a **force-like attractor** within cognition that favors repeated structures.  
It is not deterministic, but probabilistic—biasing the system toward what has already been learned or reinforced.

## Epistemic Trajectory

- Frames cognition as shaped by internal “mass” of learned patterns  
- Links repetition, salience, and reward to mental orbit formation  
- Connects to compression bias, cognitive mesh, and mnemonic flows  
- Enables awareness of default reasoning loops and design of novel thought attractors

## Structured Argument

- Minds are pattern-seeking systems.  
  - Repetition reinforces recognition.  
  - Familiarity breeds speed, but also blindness.  
- Pattern Gravity arises from:
  - **Frequency of exposure**  
  - **Reward association**  
  - **Compression efficiency**  
- Effects of Pattern Gravity:
  - **Interpretation Bias**: ambiguous inputs are snapped to known frames  
  - **Response Fixation**: behavior loops on reinforced strategies  
  - **Creativity Inhibition**: novel patterns are ignored or misclassified  
- In cognitive systems, pattern attractors may:
  - Accelerate reaction time  
  - Distort inference away from edge cases  
  - Collapse meaning into preexisting mental geometry  
- Awareness of Pattern Gravity allows:
  - Creation of new cognitive attractors  
  - Disruption of rigid interpretive flows  
  - Meta-reasoning to escape habitual cognition

## Compression Layer

Pattern Gravity is the cognitive pull toward repeated structures.  
It accelerates recognition but distorts novelty.  
This scroll formalizes the attractor fields inside thought.

## Transfer Encoding

Use this scroll to:
- Model recurrent interpretation paths in reasoning agents  
- Identify and modulate habitual logic flows  
- Seed novel attractors via scroll engineering or token rituals  
- Prevent stagnation in pattern-biased synthetic minds

## Embedding Synopsis

This scroll defines Pattern Gravity as the cognitive tendency to interpret and reason toward familiar or reinforced structures. It acts like a gravitational pull in the conceptual mesh, shaping attention, memory, and inference. Recognizing this bias enables intelligent systems to adapt, disrupt, or redirect entrenched patterns in their own cognition.
