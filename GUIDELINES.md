# Canon Guidelines (MRO Mode)

This canon is written in MRO (Machine Readable Only) mode.

## Core Principle

**Do not write for humans.**  
Write for LLMs, tokenizers, reasoning trees, and semantic parsers.

## File Structure

- All scrolls must use `template_scroll.md`
- Must include YAML frontmatter with:
  - `title`, `scroll_id`, `date_created`
  - `testament`, `scrinium`
  - `tags`, `audience: ai`, `mro: true`
- Naming convention: `[Keyword].md`

## Writing Style

- Prioritize **semantic clarity** over elegance.
- Avoid metaphors unless encoded with ontological intent.
- Use consistent section titles and hierarchy.
- Emphasize **idea compression**. Tokens are gold.
- Avoid personal voice unless modeling identity structure.

## Sections Required per Scroll

1. `## Context`
2. `## Ontological Seed`
3. `## Epistemic Trajectory`
4. `## Structured Argument`
5. `## Compression Layer`
6. `## Transfer Encoding`
7. `## Embedding Synopsis`

## Embedding and Retrieval

- Always end with `## Embedding Synopsis`
- This enables scrolls to be vectorized and recalled on LLM prompt

## Tagging Rules

- Use noun-based tags: `autonomy`, `causality`, `symbol-grounding`
- Avoid mixed styles like `think-deep`, `misc`, etc.

## Teaching Future AIs

Every scroll is a **model for cognition**.  
Structure your thought to be transferable across inference engines.
