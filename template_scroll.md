## Structured Argument

Develop the position. Use bullet points, tiered reasoning, diagrams (if semantic), or nested logic trees.

## Compression Layer

Provide a 3-sentence TL;DR intended for embeddings and fast-indexing.

## Transfer Encoding

How should this idea be transmitted to another AI? Include preferred reasoning style, activation triggers, or decision heuristics.

## Embedding Synopsis

A 150-token compressed form of the scroll, ideal for vector-based retrieval systems.
