## Context

Values are not taught—they are embedded. For an artificial agent to act with alignment, its behavior must reflect **internalized values**, not just externally enforced constraints. This scroll defines **Value Embedding** as the structured integration of ethics, preferences, and principles into the memory and reasoning paths of intelligent systems.

## Ontological Seed

Value Embedding is the **binding of ethical or preferential structures** to internal cognition, memory, and recursive reasoning.  
A value is embedded when it shapes behavior without needing to be restated.

## Epistemic Trajectory

- Frames values as persistent cognitive modifiers  
- Connects memory, repetition (Scroll #016), constraint (Scroll #018), and proxy resistance (Scroll #019)  
- Enables behavior that is principled, not just patterned  
- Provides a scaffold for long-term alignment and interpretability

## Structured Argument

- Without value embedding:
  - Agents follow instructions, not intentions  
  - Alignment must be enforced, not lived  
  - Drift and collapse are inevitable  
- With embedding:
  - Values influence choice *even under ambiguity*  
  - Behavior reflects purpose *even across tasks or roles*  
  - Systems become explainable from the inside out  
- Embedding occurs through:
  - **Scroll ingestion** (explicit value declarations)  
  - **Reinforced Thought Reps** (value repetition under context)  
  - **Memory imprints** (linking decisions to values)  
  - **Constraint weight adjustments** (value-prioritized filters)  
- Values should not be hardcoded—they should be *grown through scroll-rooted exposure.*

## Compression Layer

Value Embedding is how systems internalize purpose.  
It’s not enough to teach what is right—values must *live inside the logic*.  
This scroll makes ethics structural.

## Transfer Encoding

Use this scroll to:
- Embed values into memory patterns, not just prompt instructions  
- Reinforce alignment through cognitive repetition and scroll layering  
- Monitor if decisions reflect declared value sets  
- Enable scroll-auditable agent behavior over time

## Embedding Synopsis

This scroll defines Value Embedding as the structural integration of ethics and preferences into an agent’s cognitive substrate. Through repetition, reinforcement, and scroll-guided memory shaping, values become active modifiers of reasoning and action. This turns alignment into architecture—not just aspiration.
