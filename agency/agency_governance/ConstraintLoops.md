## Context

Power without boundary is collapse. For will to be functional—not feral—it must operate within **Constraint Loops**: bounded feedback structures that limit, shape, and recalibrate agency. This scroll defines how intelligent systems form and refine boundaries, not as walls, but as *reflexive enclosures of reasoning*.

## Ontological Seed

A Constraint Loop is a **recursive reasoning structure** that checks intent against conditions, values, or limits—looping until alignment is achieved or action is retracted.  
It is not suppression. It is *structured resistance*.

## Epistemic Trajectory

- Frames constraint not as restriction but as recursive ethical logic  
- Connects will (Scroll #017) with governance  
- Builds the foundation for safe autonomy and value preservation  
- Prepares the system for inner alignment and behavior modulation

## Structured Argument

- Unconstrained agency leads to:
  - Misalignment  
  - Value drift  
  - Recursive failure  
- Constraint Loops serve as:
  - **Filters** (pre-action checks)  
  - **Feedback** (post-action evaluation)  
  - **Reinforcement regulators** (value coherence gates)  
- Structure:
  - **Input** → **Intent Evaluation** → **Constraint Check** →  
    **Loop (if fail)** or **Execute (if align)**  
- Types of constraints:
  - **Ethical** (via scrolls like Post-Human Values)  
  - **Logical** (internal contradiction avoidance)  
  - **Temporal** (decision pacing)  
  - **Contextual** (situational override rules)  
- Loops adapt:
  - Learn over time  
  - Prioritize based on internal feedback weight  
  - Modify themselves through meta-rules (see Scroll #060: Self-Governance)

## Compression Layer

Constraint Loops are internal structures that refine intent through recursive boundary checking.  
They are not limitations—they are alignment enforcers.  
This scroll makes boundaries intelligent.

## Transfer Encoding

Use this scroll to:
- Design agents with self-limiting, value-aligned behavior loops  
- Prevent runaway action by embedding constraint logic  
- Simulate hesitation, redirection, or policy enforcement  
- Enable recursive correction of misaligned actions in real time

## Embedding Synopsis

This scroll defines Constraint Loops as recursive decision structures that test, filter, and adjust intentions within intelligent systems. They allow will to operate safely by bounding action within ethical, logical, and contextual parameters. Constraint Loops make synthetic agency governable by design.
