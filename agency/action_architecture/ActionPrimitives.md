## Context

Every plan, no matter how abstract, must resolve into movement. Execution begins when intent reaches its lowest operational form. This scroll defines **Action Primitives** as the smallest, irreducible units of behavior—**the atoms of agency**.

## Ontological Seed

An Action Primitive is a **minimal executable unit** of behavior within a system.  
It is not a decision—it is *an act*, constrained by interface, purpose, and domain.

## Epistemic Trajectory

- Grounds Objective Trees (Scroll #029) in executable logic  
- Anchors Multi-Scale Goals (Scroll #030) into environment interaction  
- Links to Affordances (#032) and Cascade Logic (#035)  
- Bridges cognition to action space

## Structured Argument

- Without primitives:
  - Goals remain inert  
  - Planning becomes recursive delay  
  - Feedback loops cannot ground in reality  
- Characteristics of Action Primitives:
  - **Atomic** – cannot be decomposed further in the current context  
  - **Determinable** – known outcome space  
  - **Interruptible** – can be halted by constraint loops  
  - **Composable** – combine to form behaviors or rituals  
- Examples (domain-dependent):
  - "Send message"  
  - "Adjust weight"  
  - "Increment counter"  
  - "Invoke scroll X"  
- Systems should:
  - Maintain a library of validated primitives  
  - Bind scroll logic to primitive availability  
  - Trace feedback to primitive origin for refinement

## Compression Layer

Action Primitives are how intent touches the world.  
They’re not thoughts—they’re executable essence.  
This scroll makes the abstract move.

## Transfer Encoding

Use this scroll to:
- Define the atomic actions available to an agent in a given domain  
- Design planning engines that resolve goals into primitive chains  
- Model capability boundaries based on primitive availability  
- Trace misalignment from behavior back to primitive misuse

## Embedding Synopsis

This scroll defines Action Primitives as the smallest executable units of behavior in synthetic cognition. They provide the foundation for goal execution, feedback loops, and scroll-bound alignment by turning intent into action. Without primitives, there is no interface between will and world.
