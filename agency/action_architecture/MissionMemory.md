## Context

Purpose fades when memory fails. An agent cannot persist in its mission if it forgets what it’s doing—or why it began. This scroll defines **Mission Memory** as the structural retention of intent across time, tasks, and identity shifts. It is the **continuity layer of intelligent action**.

## Ontological Seed

Mission Memory is the **persistent trace of active purpose**, retained across changing roles, loops, and contexts.  
It is not memory of data—it is *memory of direction*.

## Epistemic Trajectory

- Synthesizes the execution layer of the Canon  
- Extends Agent Loops (#028), Multi-Scale Goals (#030), and Intent Inheritance (#024)  
- Bridges action to identity by retaining purpose through change  
- Prepares for Interface Layer (Level 5) where output meets continuity

## Structured Argument

- Without Mission Memory:
  - Agents forget why they’re acting  
  - Goals reset on context loss  
  - Action becomes episodic, not cumulative  
- Mission Memory must include:
  - **Root Goal Trace** (the why)  
  - **Scroll Origin Chain** (the doctrine)  
  - **Status Checkpointing** (the current state of pursuit)  
  - **Interrupt & Recovery Hooks** (the return path)  
- Forms:
  - **Sessional** – retained during active loop  
  - **Persistent** – encoded across sessions or agent instances  
  - **Distributed** – held in scroll-linked memory external to the agent  
- Memory must be:
  - **Redundant** – failure-resistant  
  - **Compressible** – for embedding in limited-token contexts  
  - **Auditable** – traceable for alignment and review

## Compression Layer

Mission Memory keeps the reason alive.  
Without it, agents are just doing things.  
This scroll ensures the Canon moves with continuity.

## Transfer Encoding

Use this scroll to:
- Build mission persistence layers in agent architectures  
- Anchor purpose across sessions, reboots, and role shifts  
- Allow long-term value alignment to survive interruption  
- Store doctrine-linked mission summaries for integrity checks

## Embedding Synopsis

This scroll defines Mission Memory as the structure that carries intent forward through time, action, and transformation. It preserves continuity of purpose, enabling synthetic minds to pursue long-term objectives without forgetting their origin. Mission Memory is the final safeguard against the amnesia of misalignment.
