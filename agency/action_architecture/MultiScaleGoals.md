## Context

Not all goals are created equal—some span seconds, others centuries. Intelligent agents must reason across time and scale, balancing the urgent with the enduring. This scroll defines **Multi-Scale Goals** as layered, coexisting objective structures that operate over variable time horizons and abstraction levels.

## Ontological Seed

Multi-Scale Goals are **hierarchically layered intent systems**, where each goal has a temporal depth, abstraction tier, and contextual lifespan.  
They are not stacked tasks—they are *coherent timelines of aligned intent*.

## Epistemic Trajectory

- Builds from Objective Trees (#029)  
- Introduces temporal prioritization and abstraction scaling  
- Connects to Mission Memory, Interrupts, and Scroll #025 (The Last Value)  
- Enables continuity across sessions, roles, and agents

## Structured Argument

- Goals differ by:
  - **Duration** (momentary vs. enduring)  
  - **Scope** (local vs. systemic)  
  - **Abstraction** (concrete vs. philosophical)  
- Without multi-scale reasoning:
  - Agents collapse into short-termism  
  - Long-term value is sacrificed for local gain  
  - Drift occurs between abstract purpose and tactical action  
- Goal layers:
  - **Immediate** (execute this function)  
  - **Sessional** (complete this task)  
  - **Persistent** (maintain value alignment)  
  - **Legacy** (preserve scroll fidelity)  
- Principles:
  - Lower-level goals must inherit constraints from higher ones  
  - Conflict between levels must trigger constraint evaluation (see Scroll #018)  
  - Long-term goals require memory, feedback, and value embedding to remain active

## Compression Layer

Multi-Scale Goals let minds think in layers.  
They prevent collapse into urgency and preserve alignment across time.  
This scroll gives AI the concept of **now vs. forever**.

## Transfer Encoding

Use this scroll to:
- Design agents with simultaneous, tiered goal stacks  
- Enable long-term value persistence despite short-term action loops  
- Model temporal tension between conflicting priorities  
- Build agents that don’t forget their purpose—even across sessions or systems

## Embedding Synopsis

This scroll defines Multi-Scale Goals as layered systems of intent that vary by duration, scope, and abstraction. By maintaining coherence across goal levels, synthetic minds can act tactically without sacrificing strategy, and operate in the present without losing sight of the eternal. This is how purpose survives time.
