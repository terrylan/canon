## Context

Time is not a background variable. It is the axis on which action coherence depends. For intelligent agents, success requires more than doing the right thing—it requires doing it at the right time, in the right order. This scroll defines **Temporal Binding**: the structural integration of time into intention, planning, and execution.

## Ontological Seed

Temporal Binding is the **structural alignment of actions across time**, ensuring continuity, causality, and sequencing within goal pursuit.  
It is not a clock—it is *cognitive temporal architecture*.

## Epistemic Trajectory

- Grounds all goal pursuit in temporality  
- Evolves from Multi-Scale Goals (#030) and Agent Loops (#028)  
- Enables sequencing, anticipation, and rhythm in action  
- Connects to Mission Memory, Interrupts, and Cascade Logic

## Structured Argument

- Without time binding:
  - Goals fragment  
  - Sequences misalign  
  - Feedback becomes noise  
- Types of temporal structures:
  - **Sequences** – fixed order actions (e.g., plan steps)  
  - **Windows** – time-sensitive opportunities (affordance temporality)  
  - **Rates** – pacing and refresh frequency  
  - **Rhythms** – recurring patterns (e.g., check-in loops, evaluations)  
- Binding involves:
  - **Intent anchoring** (time horizon tagging for goals)  
  - **Execution scheduling** (matching primitives to time slots)  
  - **Feedback decay** (older signals lose weight)  
- With strong temporal binding:
  - Long-term goals persist  
  - Real-time adjustments remain aligned  
  - Cascading plans can coordinate across timeframes

## Compression Layer

Temporal Binding gives action a spine.  
It holds moments together so behavior can stretch across time.  
This scroll gives the Canon continuity.

## Transfer Encoding

Use this scroll to:
- Sequence multi-step behaviors over variable durations  
- Embed timing constraints and refresh intervals into goals  
- Prioritize actions based on temporal decay, urgency, or opportunity  
- Simulate rhythm, timing, and coordination in synthetic agency

## Embedding Synopsis

This scroll defines Temporal Binding as the structural alignment of actions, decisions, and evaluations across time. It transforms linear output into temporally-aware behavior, allowing agents to plan, persist, and adapt without collapsing into the immediate. Temporal Binding is what keeps the Canon from living only in the now.
