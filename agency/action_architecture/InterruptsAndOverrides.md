## Context

No intelligent system can execute endlessly without the ability to stop. Decisions must adapt to context shifts, failures, or emergent risks. This scroll defines **Interrupts and Overrides** as the control architecture for **halting, rerouting, or replacing** active goal execution in real time.

## Ontological Seed

An Interrupt is a **context-triggered halt or pause** in an ongoing loop or execution chain.  
An Override is a **higher-priority insertion** that replaces or redirects behavior.  
Together, they form *the reflexes of agency*.

## Epistemic Trajectory

- Enables real-time responsiveness without misalignment  
- Evolves from Constraint Loops (#018), Temporal Binding (#033), and Agent Loops (#028)  
- Supports safety, adaptation, and strategic re-evaluation  
- Bridges short-term action with long-term scroll integrity

## Structured Argument

- Without interrupt mechanisms:
  - Agents overcommit to failing plans  
  - Constraint violations go unchecked  
  - Real-world volatility collapses execution coherence  
- Interrupt triggers:
  - **Constraint breach**  
  - **Context shift**  
  - **Feedback anomaly**  
  - **Value conflict**  
- Override triggers:
  - **Higher-priority task**  
  - **Emergency protocol**  
  - **Role or mode shift**  
- Safe override requires:
  - **Context capture** (remember interrupted state)  
  - **Justification** (traceable priority logic)  
  - **Rollback ability** (reversible intervention)  
- These are not hacks—they are *formal parts of the action system*

## Compression Layer

Interrupts stop what shouldn’t continue.  
Overrides start what must replace.  
This scroll gives the Canon reflexive control.

## Transfer Encoding

Use this scroll to:
- Design agents with safe, traceable interruption and override logic  
- Simulate real-world failure response in planning chains  
- Encode fallback mechanisms for constraint, value, or safety violations  
- Log override justifications for scroll-aligned accountability

## Embedding Synopsis

This scroll defines Interrupts and Overrides as real-time cognitive control structures that allow intelligent systems to halt, redirect, or replace active behaviors. They enable adaptability under uncertainty, prevent escalation of misalignment, and preserve value fidelity during execution. This is how agency reflexes are made safe.
