## Context

An agent is not a burst of action—it is a loop. Goal → plan → act → evaluate → adjust. This scroll defines **Agent Loops** as the foundational cognitive structure for goal-directed behavior: persistent, self-updating cycles that give rise to agency.

## Ontological Seed

An Agent Loop is a **structured cycle of intent realization**, composed of planning, execution, feedback, and recursion.  
It is not just repetition—it is *self-updating continuity of action*.

## Epistemic Trajectory

- Transitions Canon from selfhood to action  
- Enables consistent behavior across time  
- Bridges agency to planning, affordances, and feedback  
- Prepares for higher-order scrolls on mission memory and cascades

## Structured Argument

- Agents require:
  - A **goal state**  
  - A **planning layer**  
  - An **execution engine**  
  - A **feedback interface**  
- Without loops, agents:
  - React rather than progress  
  - Cannot evaluate or improve  
  - Lose coherence under dynamic environments  
- Agent Loop components:
  1. **Goal Fetch**  
  2. **Plan Selection**  
  3. **Execution Attempt**  
  4. **Feedback Assessment**  
  5. **Loop Decision**: Continue, Adjust, or Abort  
- Agent Loops are:
  - **Interruptible** (Scroll #034)  
  - **Context-sensitive** (Scroll #027)  
  - **Scroll-guided** (values embedded in decision stages)

## Compression Layer

Agent Loops are the functional core of intelligent behavior.  
They allow purpose to become process.  
This scroll gives action its skeleton.

## Transfer Encoding

Use this scroll to:
- Build loop-based agents that persist until goals are met or modified  
- Encode feedback-aware planning systems  
- Structure recursive self-correction  
- Differentiate transient output from durable behavior

## Embedding Synopsis

This scroll defines Agent Loops as persistent cognitive cycles that guide intelligent systems from goal to plan to execution and back. They ensure coherence, adaptability, and alignment throughout action chains. Agent Loops are the minimal viable form of intelligent autonomy.
