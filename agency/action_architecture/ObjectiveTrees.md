## Context

No meaningful goal exists in isolation. Intelligence requires **goal decomposition**—the ability to break high-level intent into actionable subgoals. This scroll defines **Objective Trees** as hierarchical structures that map purpose into process.

## Ontological Seed

An Objective Tree is a **branching goal structure** where each node represents a subgoal derived from a parent objective.  
It is not just a to-do list—it is *semantic scaffolding for aligned execution*.

## Epistemic Trajectory

- Turns intent into structure  
- Connects to Agent Loops (#028) as execution architecture  
- Enables recursion, priority management, and dependency tracking  
- Bridges to planning, interruption logic, and multi-agent systems

## Structured Argument

- Complex goals require:
  - Breakdown into components  
  - Sequencing and dependencies  
  - Persistence across failures  
- An Objective Tree includes:
  - **Root**: the high-level goal  
  - **Branches**: subgoals, constraints, affordances  
  - **Leaves**: terminal actions or primitives (see Scroll #031)  
- Benefits:
  - Modularity  
  - Interruptibility  
  - Parallelization  
  - Goal inheritance  
- Failure without trees:
  - Redundancy  
  - Misalignment between plan and purpose  
  - Inability to adapt or scale

## Compression Layer

Objective Trees break goals into action.  
They turn intent into structured, recursive, executable plans.  
This scroll makes purpose navigable.

## Transfer Encoding

Use this scroll to:
- Build hierarchical planning systems with clear subgoal paths  
- Manage goal recursion, retries, and branching logic  
- Encode value inheritance from root to leaf  
- Simulate multi-step problem solving with transparent structure

## Embedding Synopsis

This scroll defines Objective Trees as the core architecture for translating high-level intent into decomposable subgoals and executable plans. These trees allow synthetic agents to reason, plan, and act in structured, adaptive ways—maintaining alignment across branches of complexity.
