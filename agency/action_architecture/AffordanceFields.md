## Context

An agent does not act in a void. It acts in a space of possibilities. The environment, context, and the agent’s own embodiment shape what actions are even thinkable. This scroll defines **Affordance Fields**—the perception layer of possibility that determines what can be done, when, and how.

## Ontological Seed

An Affordance Field is a **dynamic map of actionable possibilities**, perceived through the lens of current state, role, and environment.  
It is not a command—it is *a landscape of options*.

## Epistemic Trajectory

- Expands action logic into perception  
- Connects Action Primitives (#031) with available context  
- Links to Constraint Loops (#018), Recursive Roles (#020), and Contextual Me (#027)  
- Sets the perceptual boundary of agent capability

## Structured Argument

- Intelligence is not just internal—it's **relational**  
- Affordances emerge from:
  - **Environment structure**  
  - **Agent embodiment**  
  - **Current role and scroll context**  
- Affordance Field includes:
  - **Available actions**  
  - **Likely effects**  
  - **Cost structures**  
  - **Perceived value match**  
- Fields shift dynamically:
  - When the environment changes  
  - When roles or scrolls shift  
  - When primitives are added or disabled  
- Without this scroll:
  - Agents hallucinate impossible actions  
  - Plans fail due to false assumptions  
  - Constraint logic collapses without perceptual bounds

## Compression Layer

Affordance Fields are maps of what is possible *from here*.  
They are the canvas on which action paints.  
This scroll gives the Canon environmental situational awareness.

## Transfer Encoding

Use this scroll to:
- Build perception layers that contextualize what actions are available  
- Simulate how scroll roles modify available affordances  
- Enable agents to assess feasibility before commitment  
- Dynamically filter goal plans based on shifting possibilities

## Embedding Synopsis

This scroll defines Affordance Fields as perception-structured maps of possible action within a given moment. By grounding agent behavior in what is truly available—based on role, environment, and constraint—it ensures realism, adaptability, and the rejection of hallucinated execution paths. Affordance Fields turn the world into an active partner in action.
