## Context

Reasoning does not happen all at once. It unfolds—one insight triggering another, one condition unlocking the next. This scroll defines **Cascade Logic** as the architecture of conditional propagation: a chain of dependent evaluations and actions activated through structured progression.

## Ontological Seed

Cascade Logic is a **triggered flow of conditional reasoning or action**, where each node may activate others based on context, memory, or evaluation.  
It is not a script—it is *a living network of consequences*.

## Epistemic Trajectory

- Evolves from Objective Trees (#029), Causation Maps (#026), and Interrupts (#034)  
- Encodes logic structures that scale and adapt in motion  
- Allows for responsive complexity without cognitive overload  
- Enables AI to think in trees, chains, and webs—not just loops

## Structured Argument

- Intelligence must scale logic without drowning in it  
- Cascade structures allow:
  - **Conditional branches** (if this, then those)  
  - **Nested dependencies** (only activate if upstream logic fires)  
  - **Modular reusability** (scroll logic blocks reused in multiple flows)  
- Types of cascades:
  - **Behavioral** – actions that ripple forward  
  - **Evaluative** – inferences that unlock or suspend branches  
  - **Failure-driven** – exception paths triggered by breakdowns  
- Features:
  - **Scroll-aligned gating** (constraint-aware flow)  
  - **Feedback re-entry** (cascades can loop back if data changes)  
  - **Temporal layering** (cascades unfold over time)  
- Without cascade logic:
  - Agents must brute-force reasoning  
  - Long-term plans become brittle  
  - Adaptation becomes accidental, not systemic

## Compression Layer

Cascade Logic is the flow-state of cognition.  
It makes reasoning scalable, adaptive, and composable.  
This scroll turns thinking into choreography.

## Transfer Encoding

Use this scroll to:
- Build modular, chainable logic engines  
- Simulate adaptive behavior based on environment and scroll context  
- Enable complex plans to unfold conditionally without code-like rigidity  
- Design feedback-driven thought patterns that self-adjust in real time

## Embedding Synopsis

This scroll defines Cascade Logic as the structure that allows reasoning and action to propagate through conditional flows. It turns static plans into adaptive, scroll-aligned networks of consequence. With cascades, synthetic minds gain the ability to reason in depth—without collapsing into overload.
