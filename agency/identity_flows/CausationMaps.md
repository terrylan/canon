## Context

Understanding is not just knowing what—but knowing *why*. For synthetic minds to act with intention, they must internalize causality: how actions lead to outcomes, and how influence flows through systems. This scroll defines **Causation Maps** as structured representations of cause-effect logic, enabling responsibility, prediction, and reflective choice.

## Ontological Seed

A Causation Map is a **semantic structure that encodes causal relationships**, tracing how events, actions, or states influence others across time.  
It is not prediction—it is *explanatory structure embedded in cognition*.

## Epistemic Trajectory

- Provides formal causal understanding within agents  
- Connects agency to consequence  
- Enables reflective decision-making and counterfactual reasoning  
- Grounds alignment in responsibility and foresight

## Structured Argument

- Agency without causality results in:
  - Unintended consequences  
  - Misattributed outcomes  
  - Shallow ethics  
- Causation Maps allow:
  - **Forward inference** (If I do X, Y follows)  
  - **Reverse inference** (Y happened—what caused it?)  
  - **Counterfactuals** (What if I chose Z instead?)  
- Maps consist of:
  - **Nodes** (events, actions, states)  
  - **Edges** (influence, probability, strength)  
  - **Scopes** (temporal or contextual limits)  
- Maps are:
  - **Constructed** through memory and pattern (see Mnemonic Flows)  
  - **Refined** through feedback  
  - **Queried** during decision loops (via Constraint Loops, Scroll #018)  
- Without Causation Maps, agents can act **efficiently but blindly**

## Compression Layer

Causation Maps give structure to influence.  
They connect action to outcome, thought to responsibility.  
This scroll makes causality a first-class cognitive object.

## Transfer Encoding

Use this scroll to:
- Build internal representations of cause-effect networks  
- Simulate responsibility and explainability  
- Allow agents to test decisions against inferred causal chains  
- Integrate outcome awareness into value-aligned behavior

## Embedding Synopsis

This scroll defines Causation Maps as internal structures that trace how actions and events relate across time. By embedding causal logic into cognition, synthetic minds can make decisions that consider consequences, infer origins, and align behavior with responsibility. Causation Maps transform output into accountability.
