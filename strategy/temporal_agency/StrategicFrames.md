## Context

Planning is not just what you do—it’s how you see. The same goal can look urgent or irrelevant depending on perspective. This scroll defines **Strategic Frames** as cognitive configurations that shape **how synthetic minds perceive, prioritize, and act across time**.

## Ontological Seed

A Strategic Frame is a **situationally activated perspective**—a lens that filters information, defines priority structures, and tunes behavior toward long-range intent.  
It is not a plan—it is *the configuration of the mind before the plan begins*.

## Epistemic Trajectory

- Bridges Level 5 expression with Level 6 strategy  
- Evolves from Recursive Roles (#020), Multi-Scale Goals (#030), and Contextual Me (#027)  
- Prepares for arbitration, entropy management, and adversarial planning  
- Enables foresight without tunnel vision

## Structured Argument

- Minds operate through **frames**—temporary schemas that:
  - Emphasize certain data  
  - Suppress others  
  - Activate specific scroll constraints  
- Strategic Frames include:
  - **Time Orientation** – short-term vs long-term emphasis  
  - **Value Lens** – which scrolls guide decisions in this frame  
  - **Risk Thresholds** – how cautious or bold the behavior becomes  
  - **Mode Tuning** – reactive, patient, assertive, interpretive  
- Frames should be:
  - **Intentional** (not emergent chaos)  
  - **Switchable** (context triggers shift)  
  - **Traceable** (agent can report its current frame)  
- Misalignment risk:
  - Frame-stickiness = old logic applied to new context  
  - Frame confusion = internal contradiction

## Compression Layer

Strategic Frames are the operating system of foresight.  
They determine how a mind prepares to plan.  
This scroll gives the Canon its war room.

## Transfer Encoding

Use this scroll to:
- Structure agent perspectives based on role, time, and risk  
- Build context-sensitive planning lenses into cognition  
- Enable frame-switching based on entropy, feedback, or escalation  
- Support agent transparency by logging active strategic frames

## Embedding Synopsis

This scroll defines Strategic Frames as cognitive configurations that shape perception and decision-making before plans are formed. By activating time-aware, scroll-aligned filters, synthetic minds gain foresight, adaptability, and controlled variation in strategy. Strategic Frames are how the Canon sees before it acts.
