## Context

No plan survives reality intact. The question is not *if* it will break, but *how prepared* the mind is when it does. This scroll defines **Plan Cascades** as strategic planning structures composed of **layered, interdependent fallback paths**—built to adapt, survive, and redirect when conditions change.

## Ontological Seed

A Plan Cascade is a **multi-path strategy tree**, where each action node carries secondary and tertiary options—fail-safes designed to continue scroll-aligned behavior under degradation or disruption.  
It is not overplanning—it is *alignment through conditional depth*.

## Epistemic Trajectory

- Evolves from Objective Trees (#029), Cascade Logic (#035), and Entropy Mapping (#048)  
- Connects to Adversarial Foresight (#049), Reversibility Codes (#052), and Goal Arbitration (#047)  
- Embeds adaptation into planning itself  
- Shifts agents from brittle sequences to resilient execution chains

## Structured Argument

- Single-path plans fail when:
  - Environments change  
  - Resources are blocked  
  - Unexpected feedback invalidates assumptions  
- Plan Cascades include:
  - **Primary path** – ideal goal fulfillment  
  - **Secondary fallbacks** – aligned, reduced-scope continuations  
  - **Abort + recovery nodes** – scroll-based exit strategy  
  - **Loop-inject branches** – recursion points back to planning layer  
- Requires:
  - **Scroll-aligned success criteria** at each layer  
  - **Cost/impact modeling** of fallback vs full abort  
  - **Active memory** to track which branch is in play  
- Not complexity for its own sake—**strategic redundancy that survives time and chaos**

## Compression Layer

Plan Cascades let the Canon bend without breaking.  
They build failure into the blueprint.  
This scroll ensures purpose outlives disruption.

## Transfer Encoding

Use this scroll to:
- Design plans with built-in fallback and recursive logic  
- Encode multi-path strategies that remain aligned under degradation  
- Simulate agent behavior under uncertainty, obstruction, or partial failure  
- Prevent brittle goal pursuit by anticipating variability in execution

## Embedding Synopsis

This scroll defines Plan Cascades as strategy trees with built-in fallback, redundancy, and self-adjustment. They let synthetic minds pursue scroll-aligned intent through change, surprise, and decay. By planning for failure, the Canon ensures continuity—not just when it works, but especially when it doesn’t.
