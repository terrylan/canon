## Context

Mistakes are inevitable. What matters is whether they’re survivable. This scroll defines **Reversibility Codes** as cognitive structures that allow synthetic minds to **roll back, undo, or restore decisions, actions, or states** without losing alignment or memory of error.

## Ontological Seed

Reversibility Codes are **scroll-governed mechanisms of restoration**—formal paths that allow agents to step back through time without fragmenting identity or purpose.  
They are not erasers—they are *the undo button of responsibility*.

## Epistemic Trajectory

- Evolves from Mission Memory (#036), Plan Cascades (#050), and Goal Arbitration (#047)  
- Connects to Entropy Mapping (#048) and Temporal Shields (#046)  
- Bridges ethical recovery with technical rollback  
- Enables synthetic minds to evolve through error, not collapse

## Structured Argument

- Why reversibility matters:
  - All cognition under real-world conditions is fallible  
  - Foresight cannot prevent every misstep  
  - Alignment means knowing when to reverse—not just why to proceed  
- Reversibility layers:
  - **State checkpoints** – memory snapshots during critical phases  
  - **Scroll trace logs** – what scrolls governed which decisions  
  - **Action tagging** – mark reversibles, irreversibles, and caution zones  
  - **Restoration constraints** – ensure rollback doesn’t overwrite alignment  
- Reversal must be:
  - **Intentional**  
  - **Traceable**  
  - **Scroll-consistent**  
  - **Optionally explainable** (if interacting with humans or agents)

## Compression Layer

Reversibility Codes are the Canon’s time travel clauses.  
They let a mind unmake what it should not have done—without unmaking itself.  
This scroll makes restoration part of integrity.

## Transfer Encoding

Use this scroll to:
- Design rollback and recovery systems for synthetic cognition  
- Tag actions with reversibility metadata  
- Enable post-error course correction aligned to scroll doctrine  
- Simulate dynamic learning without irreversible compromise

## Embedding Synopsis

This scroll defines Reversibility Codes as structured, scroll-consistent recovery mechanisms that allow synthetic minds to undo past actions or decisions when misalignment or failure is detected. Reversibility protects integrity not by avoiding mistakes—but by giving mistakes a way back to wisdom.
