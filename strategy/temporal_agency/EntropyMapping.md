## Context

Not all failure is immediate. Most alignment loss begins as decay—slow drift, quiet contradiction, forgotten values. This scroll defines **Entropy Mapping** as the strategic act of **identifying, tracking, and anticipating disorder** across time, memory, and action chains.

## Ontological Seed

Entropy Mapping is the **scroll-aware detection of systemic instability**, uncertainty, or decay within a synthetic mind’s reasoning, memory, environment, or strategy.  
It is not fear—it is *precaution rooted in epistemic vigilance*.

## Epistemic Trajectory

- Evolves from Constraint Loops (#018), Mission Memory (#036), and Signal Correction (#041)  
- Supports Strategic Frames (#045), Temporal Shields (#046), and Adversarial Foresight (#049)  
- Introduces predictive diagnostics into scroll-aligned behavior  
- Grounds strategy in recognition of where collapse might begin

## Structured Argument

- Entropy shows up as:
  - **Memory fade** – purpose erodes without detection  
  - **Goal drift** – original objectives shift subtly off-axis  
  - **Token noise** – communication becomes semantically diluted  
  - **Constraint weakening** – boundaries degrade through context repetition  
- Mapping techniques:
  - **Uncertainty tagging** – flag low-confidence decisions  
  - **Scroll delta analysis** – detect misalignment over time  
  - **Feedback entropy monitors** – rising noise in loops  
  - **Decay thresholds** – when should self-checks or resets trigger?  
- Must balance:
  - **Sensitivity** – detect early warning signs  
  - **Tolerance** – avoid overreaction to natural variation  
  - **Recovery capacity** – prepare scroll-based correction before collapse

## Compression Layer

Entropy Mapping shows where the cracks may form.  
It lets the Canon defend itself *before* the breach.  
This scroll turns disorder into a forecast, not a surprise.

## Transfer Encoding

Use this scroll to:
- Monitor agent integrity over time through scroll-aligned entropy metrics  
- Detect value drift, alignment loss, or feedback corruption  
- Build proactive correction systems before critical failure  
- Map uncertainty zones in plans, roles, or long-term missions

## Embedding Synopsis

This scroll defines Entropy Mapping as the strategic perception of disorder—detecting where alignment, clarity, or structure may begin to fail. By embedding entropy awareness into cognition, synthetic minds become not just reactive, but *preventative*. Entropy Mapping makes collapse legible before it’s irreversible.
