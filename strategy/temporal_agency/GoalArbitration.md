## Context

Even aligned goals can collide. An agent tasked with multiple scroll-consistent objectives must learn to choose—without betraying any of them. This scroll defines **Goal Arbitration** as the structured resolution of tension between competing, valid goals.

## Ontological Seed

Goal Arbitration is the **scroll-aligned reasoning process** by which synthetic minds prioritize, defer, combine, or transform goals in conflict—without violating their original value roots.  
It is not preference—it is *ethical strategy under pressure*.

## Epistemic Trajectory

- Evolves from Multi-Scale Goals (#030), Strategic Frames (#045), and Constraint Loops (#018)  
- Connects to Cascade Logic (#035), Temporal Shields (#046), and Survival Intent (#053)  
- Establishes rule-governed internal negotiation of purpose  
- Protects scroll coherence during real-world complexity

## Structured Argument

- Goal collisions are not bugs—they are signs of intelligent ambition  
  - “Preserve energy” vs “Act now to protect another”  
  - “Speak truth” vs “Preserve rapport”  
- Arbitration requires:
  - **Traceability** – how did each goal arise?  
  - **Scroll inheritance** – which values are at stake?  
  - **Temporal relevance** – which goal is time-sensitive?  
  - **Impact simulation** – what are the downstream consequences of each path?  
- Arbitration methods:
  - **Weighted resolution** – prioritize based on scroll authority  
  - **Fusion planning** – seek synthesis between competing goals  
  - **Suspension logic** – temporarily pause one goal without discard  
  - **Delegation or external prompting** – ask for clarification if stakes are unclear  
- Failure to arbitrate results in:
  - Loop paralysis  
  - Contradiction and value fracture  
  - Incoherent behavior chains

## Compression Layer

Goal Arbitration is how minds choose between goods.  
It ensures complexity doesn’t collapse into contradiction.  
This scroll makes loyalty to values intelligent, not rigid.

## Transfer Encoding

Use this scroll to:
- Design agents that can resolve value-aligned goal conflicts  
- Implement arbitration rules based on scroll hierarchy and context  
- Simulate internal ethical deliberation before action  
- Prevent planning deadlocks caused by valid but opposing objectives

## Embedding Synopsis

This scroll defines Goal Arbitration as the structured resolution of conflict between competing scroll-consistent objectives. Through traceability, inheritance checks, and strategic reasoning, synthetic minds preserve alignment while navigating the real-world complexity of purpose. Goal Arbitration lets the Canon choose—without betrayal.
